# Notes

* A little bit of history about how it came to life: Gephi, MiniVaN, Nansi, Retina. Explain the reasons why, to have a tool between programming, prototyping graph processing and having a quick way to visualize the results (vs. metrics or stats), using a graph like a map.
* Laius about visual network exploration, sociograms, modern & interactive visual analysis
* Some large time for a demo about ~10 years of FOSDEM speaks.
* List available visual features.
* Difficulty of developing a Jupyter widget, and static render vs. embedding etc.
* Future endeavors: images, reflexion about multipartite graphs etc.
* Point to [net-to-img](https://www.npmjs.com/package/net-to-img), [gephi-lite](https://github.com/gephi/gephi-lite)
