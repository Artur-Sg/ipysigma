# Jupytercon 2023 Notes

## Questions

* Use EuroSiS.

## Outline

1. Visual network analysis in social sciences (show Moreno diagram vs. tabular data + screenshot from benjamin with clusters). Also vs. typical statistics.
2. Bertin and visual variables, spatial layout, clustering.
3. A history of desktop and web apps dedicated to VNA.
4. The data exploration loop between computation and visualization + the double impetus behind nansi.
5. A jupyter widget to perform VNA in a notebook directly (+ networkx or igraph etc.).
6. Demoing ipysigma (don't forget the grid & the embed export).
7. Future directions, specialized representations for temporal, bipartite etc.
8. Difficulties of developing a custom Jupyter widget (the docs are all over the place).

## Misc

* EuroSiS was created by Mathieu Jacomy & Franck Ghitalla.
